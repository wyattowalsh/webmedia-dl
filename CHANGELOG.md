# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Implement `build-webmedia-dl-v1` Python worker, CLI, schemas, tests, and overlay.
- Cooperative per-job pause checkpoints, mixed-media failure containment, and
  Mac-forwarded watchOS/tvOS companion messages.
- Speak/Siri intake, per-operation export checkpoints, HLS MAP/BYTERANGE,
  DASH SegmentTimeline recording, and in-flight provider cancel.
- DASH/HLS rendition selection prefers the highest-bandwidth video (or audio)
  Representation; watchOS/tvOS queue companion messages for Mac relay; share
  extensions extract HTTPS locators versus file drop paths.
- Multi-period DASH concatenates the selected video from each Period; companion
  POST accepts a one-time AES-GCM pairing envelope; visionOS share and complete
  client Files destinations use the same security-scoped path contract.
- Share extensions expose `NSExtensionRequestHandling` principals; Files
  destinations persist security-scoped `bookmarkData`; watch/tv send typed
  companion messages through a queued transport; history views decode
  `WebMediaDLHistoryEntry`; intents load stored worker credentials.
- Pairing keeps the client profile (no restricted-to-full widening) and requires
  a session key; cookies are job-bound grants, not raw paths; probe-detected
  encryption refuses closed before export.
- Queue-global pause holds per-job resume in `accepted`; live recording enforces
  an aggregate byte bound, records separate audio/video artifacts, uses yt-dlp
  for live watch pages, and concatenates multi-period SegmentBase/SegmentList
  occurrences in order.
- Export remuxes first and transcodes the original only if remux cannot satisfy
  the container; container gates use ffprobe evidence, not filename suffixes;
  `package-extensions` ships from packaged `runtime/extensions` in a wheel.
- Discovery covers picture/source MIME, AMP media, JSON-LD URL lists, and a
  provided-HTML byte cap; `plan --container` explains the export DAG; support
  bundles recursively strip console/cookie fields; `updates` checks PyPI without
  installing; migration recursively indexes every allowlisted archive marker.
